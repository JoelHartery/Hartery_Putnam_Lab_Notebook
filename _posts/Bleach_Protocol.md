#### This protocol was written by [Joel Hartery](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/) for the Putnam, Prada, and Puritz labs

1. Bleach can be made at either 10% or 20%.
2. Making bleach:  

    For a 10% bleach:

      - 500mL Flask: 50mL bleach and 450mL DI water.
    

    For a 20% bleach:  

      - 500mL Flask: 100mL bleach and 400mL DI water.

3. First grab bleach from underneath the sink and use a clean graduated cylinder and measure the desired amount.
4. Then pour into 500mL flask, rinse graduated cylinder, and leave out to dry.
5. Then use the DI water machine and another (clean) graduated cylinder to measure the desired amount of DI needed to dilute your solution.
Once this is done leave graduated cylinder to dry and mix solution well.
